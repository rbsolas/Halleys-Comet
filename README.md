# Halley's Comet - Trajectory Prediction

## About the Project
This short project of ours demonstrates an example of applying systems of differential equations and initial value problems. Here, we look at how we can reconstruct Halley's comet's predicted orbit within the next 200 years since it was last seen (1986).
